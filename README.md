## Languages & Tools I Have Utilized <br />

I have spent a lot of my free time with studying and practicing Frontend in an effort to migrate to the tech area. I have more than 12 years of UI/UX and graphic design experience and I'm trying to fuse the best of both worlds to deliver great designs with a great experience, taking advantage of frontend techniques. <br/> <br/><!--
